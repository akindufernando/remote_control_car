# remote_control_car
Here's an Arduino code example for a simple remote-controlled car that uses an Arduino Uno, Bluetooth module (e.g., HC-05 or HC-06), a motor driver module (e.g., L298N), and two gear motors. This code defines methods for moving forward, backward, turning left, and turning right.
